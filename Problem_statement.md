# Customer-Churn

**Problem Statement**
The problem statement revolves around an E-commerce company facing intense competition in the current market, making customer retention a significant challenge. The company aims to develop a model capable of predicting account churn and offering segmented offers to potential churners. Given that one account can have multiple customers, the loss of a single account affects more than one customer. Therefore, the problem is to devise a churn prediction system that can identify potential churners accurately and provide tailored offers to retain them, ultimately minimizing customer churn and maximizing customer loyalty.

**Conclusion**
The  provided raw data has been cleansed and analysed the required fields with visulaization & Interpretation. Based on that the data is split in 70:30 ratio. 70% portion of data is used for Training the ML models and the other 30% portion of data is used for Testing the ML Models.
Five Machine Learning models namely Logistic Regression, CART classifier model, Random Forest Classifier model, Bagging Classifier Model and Boosting Classifier Models are built for the Customer Churn project with the given data.
Among the five models, the Random Forest Regression model is providing good performance. Hence Random Forest Classification Model is the suggested model to build ML model for the Customer Churn project for the given data.
